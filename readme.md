# Render2D
---

A small C library for efficient 2D rendering with OpenGL (and maybe Vulkan in the future).

# How to Use

The entire library is contained within the render2.h/.c files.

You will need the gl3w OpenGL library to compile by default, but you can substitute your own OpenGL loaded pretty easily.

# Examples

See game.h/.c for a quick example game (work in progress).
